 * @description
 * Are the given dates in the same ISO week-numbering year?
 *
 * ISO week-numbering year: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `isSameISOYear` to `isSameISOWeekYear`.
 *   "ISO week year" is short for [ISO week-numbering year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).
 *   This change makes the name consistent with
 *   locale-dependent week-numbering year helpers, e.g., `getWeekYear`.
 *
 * @param dateLeft - The first date to check
 * @param dateRight - The second date to check
 * @returns The dates are in the same ISO week-numbering year
 *
 * @example
 * // Are 29 December 2003 and 2 January 2005 in the same ISO week-numbering year?
 * const result = isSameISOWeekYear(new Date(2003, 11, 29), new Date(2005, 0, 2))
 * //=> true
